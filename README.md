# Design and Hardware Validation of a Vision-based Intelligent ADAS Controller
Development of a hardware-accelerated vision-based real-time customizable ADAS controller adhering to automotive safety standards. 

Supervised by: Dr. D.H.S. Maithripala

## Scope of the Project:

To develop an Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) comprising of: 
* Highway Collision Avoidance 
* Lane keeping Assistance
  
features, that utilizes vision-based intelligent semantic object detection techniques, coupled with an adaptive 
dynamic-responsive real-time vehicle controller model with purpose-built custom algorithms. The proposed 
system must process camera video as input; and actuate vehicle steering angle, brakes, and accelerator as 
necessary. The system must adhere to industrial mission-critical safety standards.  

A model will be developed using industrial-grade specialist software simulators, and will then be optimized 
for higher performance and deployed on dedicated hardware processors (such as GPU, FPGA).

## Milestones

* Literature Survey, selection and development of the vision-based intelligent semantic object detection 
technique / method 
* Setting up the Automobile Simulator for validating and testing the controller 
* Development of the Controller Algorithm required to process the evasive maneuvers  
* Developing Algorithms to generate Control Signals required for the Actuation of Brakes, Accelerator and Steering  
* Implementation of the developed controller in FPGA / GPU hardware for hardware validation
